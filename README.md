# QA bot for Research Papers 


The Research Paper QA Bot is a solution designed to provide accurate, real-time answers to user queries based on a collection of research papers. It leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with two levels of filtering and a generative AI model to generate human-readable responses.

The system processes PDF research papers, uploads them to a Qdrant vector database, and uses vector embeddings to find relevant documents and chunks. The final context is used to formulate an easy to understand response to user queries.

## Workflow

### Data Ingestion:
- **PDF Handling**: 
  - The solution ingests research papers in PDF format.
  - Each PDF is processed to extract its text and is stored as Document objects.
- **Chunking**:
  - The extracted text is split into smaller, meaningful chunks to ensure efficient retrieval and accurate responses.

### Qdrant Vector Store:
- The first collection comprises all the research paper PDFs as points.
- Each PDF is also stored as individual collections with text chunks as points.
- **Vector Embeddings**:
  - Text chunks are converted into vector embeddings using the **Cohere** model (`embed-english-v3.0`) and stored in a Qdrant collection.
  - Each chunk represents a specific point in the Qdrant collection.

### Two-Level RAG Filtering:
- **Level 1: PDF Selection**:
  - A vector search identifies the top 5 most similar research papers (PDFs) based on the user query.
- **Level 2: Chunk Selection**:
  - From the selected PDFs, the most relevant chunks (8 from each PDF) are identified using vector search again, creating a context of 40 chunks.
  - These chunks are used to generate a consolidated answer for the user’s query.

### Generative AI Integration:
- A generative AI model (**Gemini**) processes the context (40 chunks) along with the user query to generate a coherent and accurate response.
- This ensures that the answer is both contextually relevant and human-readable.

### Web Application:
- The solution includes a web-based chatbot interface for user interaction, allowing users to:
  - Submit queries and receive responses.
  - The chatbot also provides suggestions for follow-up questions based on the user input dynamically.

- **Current Limitations**:
  - Due to resource limitations, the solution is optimized to work with 20 PDFs.
- **Scalability**:
  - The architecture is designed to be easily scalable, allowing for an increase in the database size as additional resources become available.
  - The integration with Qdrant and Cohere embeddings ensures smooth handling of larger datasets without significant structural changes.

url = "https://57d6-2401-4900-7b9d-2663-c492-2676-220e-1617.ngrok-free.app/api/chat"

payload = json.dumps({
  "prompt": "How do GLU variants improve transformer?"
})
headers = {
  'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}

response = requests.request("POST", url, headers=headers, data=payload)

print(response.text)
```

## How to Run
Clone the repo , traverse to the repo directory
Run the following commands
```

python app.py
npm start
cd chatbot
json-server -p 3500 -w src\Data\messages.json
```
The web app will run on localhost:3000 

### Future Enhancements

- **Implementing Advanced Chunking Techniques**:
  - Explore more sophisticated methods for chunking text to improve the accuracy of retrieval and response generation.

- **Semantic Caching**:
  - Implement semantic caching to reduce response time for frequently queried topics by storing and reusing previous results.

- **Integrating Batch Processing**:
  - Incorporate batch processing to handle multiple queries and large datasets simultaneously, increasing efficiency and scalability.

- **Integrating Knowledge Graphs**:
  - Leverage knowledge graphs to provide more semantically aware responses by incorporating structured relationships between concepts.

- **Enhancing Contextual Understanding**:
  - Implement a mechanism to send previously generated queries along with the current user query, improving the chatbot’s ability to maintain context across multi-turn conversations.
